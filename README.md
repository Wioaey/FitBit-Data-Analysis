# FitBit-Data-Analysis
Using RStudio and R Markdown, performed data analysis on the given DataSets.

## Project Introduction
(This is a fictional company with fictional data)
Bellabeat, a fitbit device company, has asked us to track and identify trends in their device usage by their customers. Bellabeat has 3 devices: Leaf, Time, and Spring.
The shareholders of Bellabeat have asked 3 major questions:
  1) What are some visible trends in their smart device usage?
  2) How could these trends apply to Bellabeat Customers?
  3) And how could these trends help influence Bellabeat's future marketing strategy?

## About Data
The data was given from [Kaggle](https://%20https//www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit), which contains a total of 18 csv files. 
The licensing of this dataset follows the Public Domain [CCO: Public Domain](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).
The Kaggle page does not contain a description of the dataset, but a data dictionary was found from an outside resource for the dataset ([Fitabase Fitbit Data Dictionary as of 2:14:24](https://fitabase.com/media/2085/fitabase-fitbit-data-dictionary-as-of-21424-1.pdf)).

##### Limitations:
Because of the small sample size of 30 users and the ommitment of some of their personal information, we cannot fully say the upcoming analysis is 100%.
